PythonHttpLibrary
=================

Current Version: 0.1

This is a library that facilitates http requests.
Its meaning is to make it easier for developers to make http requests.

For an example script please check "test.py".

This is an early version, there are many things left to do such as:
- create a DEBUG mode which should be activated on demand and output various data
- create response handlers for json or xml formats
- enable basic http authentication

I am also thinking of implementing some kind of plugins system which should interact with the requests and the responses.
